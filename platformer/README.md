About the provided code:
	The given code has a basic player sprite that can jump (UP key) and then fall as if affected by gravity.
	The player stops falling when resting on the bottom of the screen.
	The player can move left (LEFT key) and right (RIGHT key) at will, but will be prevented from moving off screen.
	When the player tries to move off screen, the sprite will be stopped and the surrounding environment (clouds)
	will move instead.
	The basic class representation of platforms has been provided, but customization and functionality have not.
	The clouds are grouped so that they can move similarly across the screen.
	The background is in its own group separate from the clouds because the background doesn't behave like the clouds.
	Platforms will have to have their own group for the same reason the background is not in a group with the clouds.
