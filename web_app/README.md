# Build Your Own Web App #

In this project, you can build your own web application using Flask. Our starter code creates a basic registration and login page,
allowing users to log into the app. Everything else will be up to you. Also, we have built a really simple 'database' using JSON 
(challenge: try adding a 'real' database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL). Here are some ideas of projects you could build:
* A social media website
* A checklist app
* A restaurant review site
